Estimation of regional mortality rates using Bayesian hierarchical models

# Models 
There are a collection of bayesian hierarchical models found in `StanCode` that were used for the analysis. 
Deaths are modelled using a poisson likelihood where the death rate is scaled using exposure. 

The models are fitted using **Stan**
